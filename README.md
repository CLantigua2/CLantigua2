## About Me:  :alien:
I am a FullStack Web and Computer Science alumni at **[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)**. </br>
I'm currently working as a Software Developer at **[SingleStone Consulting](https://www.singlestoneconsulting.com/)** located in Richmond, Virginia.

I enjoy working in a FrontEnd role using frameworks and libraries like <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1473950148/1161/react.png?1473950148" width="30" height="30" /> <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1483052921/1537/vue.png?1483052921" width="30" height="30" /> <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1545071486/5052/ns-angular.png?1545071486" width="30" height="30" />. On my own time I like to play around with mobile app development with Swift and VR game development on Unity. 

I am currently working on an e-commerce project that helps users sell their products and remote services in unique ways.
