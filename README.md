## About Me:  :alien:
I am a FullStack Web and Computer Science alumni at **[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)**. </br>
I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at **[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)**.

I like to explore technology and I appreciate all of the amazing things we can accomplish for people with it. I enjoy working on an applications UI and diving into ways we can make the internet more accessible to everyone. I often write blog posts about things I play around with or my general experiences working as a Software Engineer at [TheBrownDev.com](https://www.thebrowndev.com/), feel free to stop by and have a look.

I'm currently exploring some of the following interests
* AWS infrastructure and cloud services
* GoLang (very fun and interesting language)
* Kotlin (it makes Java fun)
* DIY projects in the back yard - I like to build poorly planned garden projects
* Drone photography - I'm still horrible at it <img alt="blob sweat random" title="blob sweat random" loading="lazy" src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643512993/49350/blob-sweat.gif?1643512993" width="30" height="30">
